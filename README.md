# Verlet Physics Simulation

## Introduction

Welcome to my Verlet Physics Simulation project repository! This project was an exciting learning journey for me, where I delved into the world of physics simulations and applied mathematical concepts to create dynamic and interactive simulations.

## About the Project

The Verlet Physics Simulation project is a fun and engaging exploration of physics principles using the Verlet integration method. Through this project, I aimed to:

- Understand the Verlet integration method and its application in simulating realistic physics interactions.
- Implement mathematical algorithms and concepts such as velocity, acceleration, constraints, and collision detection.
- Create interactive and visually appealing simulations that demonstrate the behavior of physical systems.

## Key Features

- **Verlet Integration**: The project utilizes the Verlet integration method to simulate physics interactions accurately.
- **Particle System**: I implemented a flexible and dynamic particle system that allows for the creation of various objects and structures.
- **Constraints and Collisions**: The simulation includes constraints to maintain relationships between particles and collision detection to handle interactions with boundaries and objects.

## Learning Journey

This project has been an incredible learning experience for me. Here are some key aspects of my learning journey:

- **Algorithm Optimization**: I focused on optimizing algorithms for efficiency and accuracy to ensure smooth and realistic simulations.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Developing this project honed my problem-solving skills, especially in tackling complex physics simulations and optimizations.
